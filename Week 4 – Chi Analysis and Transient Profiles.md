### Lecture 1: Chi Transformation
**Structure**
- **Introduction (5 min)**
  - Why chi analysis? Problem of nonlinear river profiles.
- **Core Concepts (25 min)**
  - Derivation of χ:
    - χ = ∫ (A0 / A)^m/n dx.
    - Normalization with reference area A0.
  - In steady state, χ–elevation plots are straight lines.
  - Disequilibrium: profile bends or breaks.
  - Sensitivity to m/n ratio choice.
- **Examples (10 min)**
  - Taiwan (active orogen) vs. Canadian Shield (stable craton).
- **Wrap-up (5–10 min)**
  - Quick discussion: What does a break in slope of χ-plot mean?

### Lecture 2: Applications of Chi Analysis
**Structure**
- **Introduction (5 min)**
  - Using chi for tectonic interpretation.
- **Core Concepts (25 min)**
  - Channel steepness index (ksn) as proxy for uplift rate.
  - Identifying disequilibrium: tributary mismatches, knickpoints.
  - Detecting drainage divides migration.
  - Limitations: lithologic heterogeneity, climate variability.
- **Examples (10 min)**
  - Himalayas: high ksn near thrust fronts.
  - Appalachians: low ksn, stable divide.
- **Wrap-up (5–10 min)**
  - Small group exercise: interpret a χ plot of a sample basin.

### Lab 4: Chi Analysis of River Networks
**Objectives**
- Gain hands-on skills in χ analysis.
- Learn to detect disequilibrium landscapes.

**Steps**
1. **Load DEM** and delineate catchments.
2. **Run χ-analysis tool** in TopoToolbox or Python script.
3. **Generate χ–elevation plots** for main stem and tributaries.
4. **Interpret breaks and slope changes**.
5. **Exercise**
   - Write a short interpretation: tectonic vs. lithologic vs. climatic control.
