### Lecture 1: Tectonic Controls on Landscape Evolution
**Structure**
- **Introduction (5 min)**
  - Tectonics as fundamental boundary condition.
- **Core Concepts (25 min)**
  - Modes of tectonic forcing:
    - Uplift.
    - Subsidence.
    - Isostasy.
  - Geomorphic indicators:
    - River steepness (ksn).
    - Basin asymmetry.
    - Drainage captures.
- **Examples (10 min)**
  - Southern Alps (NZ): rapid uplift.
  - Basin asymmetry in Apennines.
- **Wrap-up (5 min)**
  - Discussion: What signals differentiate tectonic from climate?

### Lecture 2: Quantitative Tectonic Metrics
**Structure**
- **Introduction (5 min)**
  - Quantifying tectonic signals with DEMs.
- **Core Concepts (25 min)**
  - Hypsometric curves and integral.
  - Basin asymmetry index (AF).
  - Chi-analysis with tectonic interpretation.
  - Case studies:
    - Himalaya.
    - Andes.
    - Alps.
- **Examples (10 min)**
  - Chi plots across thrust fronts.
- **Wrap-up (5 min)**
  - Students interpret a tectonic dataset.

### Lab 11: Tectonic Metrics in DEMs
**Objectives**
- Apply quantitative metrics to tectonic landscapes.

**Steps**
1. **Extract river profiles** from tectonically active area.
2. **Compute ksn maps** with chi analysis.
3. **Calculate hypsometric integrals**.
4. **Basin asymmetry analysis**.
5. **Exercise**
   - Short report: evidence of active tectonics in assigned basin.
