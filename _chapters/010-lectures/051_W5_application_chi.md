# Interpreting Chi and Channel Steepness in Tectonic Context

## 1. Introduction: From Transformation to Interpretation
- Chi transforms river profiles.
- Interpretation requires tectonic context.
- Reminder:
  > *Metrics do not interpret themselves.*

###

## Channel Steepness (ksn) Revisited

## What ksn Actually Represents
- ksn combines:
  - slope,
  - drainage area normalization,
  - assumed concavity (θref).
- Conceptual meaning:
  - relative measure of erosion demand.

## ksn and Uplift
- Higher uplift → higher required incision → higher ksn.
- Spatial patterns of ksn reflect:
  - fault zones,
  - uplift gradients,
  - tectonic segmentation.

## Detecting Tectonic Signals with Chi (25 min)

## Knickpoints in Chi Space
- Vertical offsets in χ–z plots.
- Interpreting:
  - migrating knickpoints (uplift or base-level change),
  - stationary knickpoints (lithologic control).

## Tributary Consistency
- In steady state:
  - tributaries align with main stem in chi space.
- Misalignment indicates:
  - transient response,
  - divide migration,
  - drainage capture.

## What Can Go Wrong 

## Lithologic Effects
- Resistant rock can mimic tectonic signal.
- Importance of independent geological information.

## Climatic Modulation
- Precipitation gradients affect discharge–area scaling.
- Chi assumes constant runoff efficiency.

## Choice of m/n Ratio
- Sensitivity to concavity index.
- Why standard values (e.g. 0.45–0.6) are used.

## Integrating Chi with Other Indicators

- Best practice:
  - chi + ksn + hypsometry + basin asymmetry.
- Spatial coherence:
  - alignment with mapped faults.
- Temporal reasoning:
  - knickpoint position as response time indicator.
