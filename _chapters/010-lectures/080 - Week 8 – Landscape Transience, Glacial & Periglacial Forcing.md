### Lecture 1: Landscape Transience
**Structure**
- **Introduction (5 min)**
  - Landscapes rarely in equilibrium.
- **Core Concepts (25 min)**
  - Equilibrium vs. disequilibrium.
  - Relaxation time and lagged response.
  - Landscape memory and hysteresis.
  - Knickpoint migration as indicator of transience.
  - Sediment waves propagating downstream.
- **Examples (10 min)**
  - Colorado Plateau knickpoint retreat.
  - Post-orogenic Appalachians.
- **Wrap-up (5 min)**
  - Q: What landforms show “memory” of past events?

### Lecture 2: Glacial & Periglacial Processes
**Structure**
- **Introduction (5 min)**
  - Cold-region processes as strong forcings on topography.
- **Core Concepts (25 min)**
  - Glacial erosion laws:
    - Basal sliding.
    - Abrasion and quarrying.
  - Landforms:
    - U-shaped valleys, cirques, overdeepenings, fjords.
  - Periglacial processes:
    - Frost creep, solifluction, ice wedges, permafrost thaw.
  - Paraglacial sediment pulses:
    - Postglacial overloading of channels.
- **Examples (10 min)**
  - Patagonian fjords.
  - European Alps deglaciation.
- **Wrap-up (5 min)**
  - Compare glacial vs. fluvial incision efficiency.

### Lab 8: Glacial and Periglacial DEM Analysis
**Objectives**
- Identify glacial and periglacial signatures in DEMs.
- Compare glaciated vs. fluvial valley cross-sections.

**Steps**
1. **Load DEMs** from glaciated and non-glaciated basins.
2. **Extract valley cross-sections**.
3. **Calculate valley-shape indices** (V-shaped vs. U-shaped).
4. **Hypsometry of glaciated basins**.
5. **Landlab exercise**:
   - Simulate base-level fall to mimic deglaciation.
6. **Exercise**
   - Write interpretation of paraglacial adjustment.
