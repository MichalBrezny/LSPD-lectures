### Lecture 2: Terrain Metrics & Hydrology
**Structure**
- **Introduction (5 min)**
  - DEM derivatives connect topography to processes.
- **Slope and Aspect (10 min)**
  - Definitions: first derivatives of elevation.
  - Importance for soil erosion, solar radiation, hydrology.
- **Curvature (10 min)**
  - Profile curvature: flow acceleration/retardation.
  - Planform curvature: convergence/divergence of flow.
- **Hypsometry (10 min)**
  - Hypsometric curve: cumulative area vs. elevation.
  - Hypsometric integral: youthful vs. mature basins.
- **Hydrological Indices (15 min)**
  - Topographic Wetness Index (TWI = ln(a / tanβ)).
  - Stream Power Index (SPI = a·tanβ).
  - Interpretation for soil moisture, flood risk.
- **Runoff Processes (10 min)**
  - Hortonian (infiltration excess).
  - Dunne (saturation excess).
  - Hydrograph: rising limb, peak, recession.
- **Wrap-up (5 min)**
  - Discuss: How does land cover affect hydrograph form?

### Lab 2: Terrain Metrics and Runoff Modelling
**Objectives**
- Extract key terrain metrics from DEMs.
- Link terrain to hydrological processes.

**Steps**
1. **Load DEM** in QGIS or SAGA.
2. **Derive terrain attributes**
   - Slope, aspect, curvature.
   - TWI and SPI.
   - Hypsometric curve for selected basins.
3. **Compare metrics across basins**
   - Different lithologies and elevations.
4. **Run rainfall–runoff model (Excel/Python)**
   - Horton infiltration curve.
   - Produce hydrographs for two soils.
5. **Exercise**
   - Write 2-page lab report:
     - Compare hydrographs between sandy vs. clay catchments.
     - Relate results to DEM-derived wetness indices.
