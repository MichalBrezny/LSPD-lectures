## Anthropocene geomorphology: three major mechanisms

### A. Dams and sediment connectivity

* Dams trap sediment, interrupt downstream continuity, and can cause downstream channel/coastal sediment starvation.
* Global synthesis: humans can increase hillslope erosion yet reduce sediment reaching coasts due to reservoir trapping. ([PubMed][11])
* Management perspective: strategies exist to pass or manage sediment in regulated rivers and reservoirs. ([Wiley Online Library][12])

### B. Mining and large-scale earth moving

* Direct topographic reconfiguration, new sediment sources, altered hydrology, and long legacy impacts (tailings, spoil, drainage network changes).

### C. Urbanization and “urban stream syndrome”

Urban watersheds often show:

* flashier hydrographs, channel incision/widening, altered sediment regimes, degraded ecological function. ([journals.uchicago.edu][13])

## Focus example (10 min): Three Gorges Dam (Yangtze/Changjiang)

* Large reservoirs can trap substantial fractions of upstream sediment and shift downstream sediment budgets.
* Example analyses quantify deposition/trapping and discuss downstream/coastal implications after Three Gorges operation. ([hess.copernicus.org][14])

## Wrap-up debate prompt

**Humans vs. glaciers — which can reshape landscapes faster?**
Use at least one **order-of-magnitude** argument (e.g., volumes moved per year; spatial extent; timescales of dominance). ([exploreiowageology.org][8])

# Key terms (quick glossary)

* **Susceptibility**: relative likelihood of occurrence (where processes are more/less likely).
* **Hazard**: probability and intensity of a damaging process (depth/velocity/runout).
* **Risk**: hazard × exposure × vulnerability.
* **Connectivity**: how efficiently sediment/water moves through a landscape (sources → sinks).
* **Validation**: independent testing of model outputs against observations.
* **Uncertainty**: data error + parameter uncertainty + structural/model-form limits.
