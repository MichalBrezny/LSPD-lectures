# The Role of Data in Quantitative Geomorphology


To sum up what we have learned so far:
  - Tectonics provides forcing.
  - Rivers respond (chi, ksn).
  - SPIM explains mechanisms.
  - LEMs simulate evolution.


# Embracing Uncertainty
In quantitative geomorphology, we use **models** to explore how landscapes might respond to tectonic forcing, climate, and surface processes. We use **data** to constrain what is physically plausible.  

Neither models nor data alone can fully explain landscape evolution:

- **Models without data** are unconstrained and speculative.
- **Data without models** are difficult to interpret mechanistically.

> **Key idea:** Models help us *ask better questions*, not provide final answers.

Scientific models are tools, not answers.

>[!Warning]
>Classic motto: Garbage in, garbage out. Models are only as good as the data and assumptions that go into them. >Understanding and quantifying uncertainty is crucial for responsible interpretation.




> *Models without data are unconstrained; data without models are hard to interpret.*

## Types of Data Used to Constrain Models
What is a constraint? Models work in some parameter space defined. When we do not know exact values of parameters, we can used data to limit the plausible range of these parameters. This is called constraining the model.

So when we look on SPIM model, we have several parameters: uplift rate (U), erodibility (K), concavity (m/n). Each of these parameters can vary within some range. Data can help us to limit these ranges. Different types of data provide different constraints:
  - uplift rate (U),
  - erodibility (K),
  - concavity (m/n),
  - diffusion coefficient (D).

## What data are used to constrain models?

### Topographic Data (Primary Constraint)
DEM-derived metrics:
  - river profiles,
  - chi plots,
  - slope distributions,
  - hypsometry.

What topography constrains:
  - relative uplift patterns,
  - transient vs. steady-state behavior,
  - spatial variability.
- Strengths:
  - spatially continuous,
  - widely available.
- Limitations:
  - integrates long time periods,
  - non-unique interpretations.

### Erosion Rate Data
#### Cosmogenic nuclides (e.g. ¹⁰Be):
We can use concentrations of cosmogenic nuclides like ¹⁰Be in river sediments to estimate basin-averaged erosion rates over timescales of 10³–10⁵ years. These measurements provide direct constraints on how quickly landscapes are lowering, which can be compared to model predictions.

- Sediment yield measurements:
  - modern erosion proxies.
- What they constrain:
  - magnitude of incision/denudation.
- Key limitation:
  - represent specific timescales,
  - not directly comparable to short-term processes.

#### Uplift and Boundary Condition Data
- Geodetic uplift (GPS):
  - short-term rates.
- Geological proxies:
  - terraces,
  - marine markers,
  - thermochronology.
- Role in models:
  - define forcing, not outcome.

###  How Data Are Used in Models (Conceptually)

#### Calibration vs. Constraint
- **Calibration**:
  - adjusting parameters to fit data.
- **Constraint** (preferred at MSc level):
  - limiting plausible parameter ranges.

In this course, we focus on **constraint**, not calibration.
> Matching the data does **not** prove the model is correct.

#### Forward vs. Inverse Thinking
- Forward modeling:
  - assume forcing → predict landscape.
  - prescribe U, K, m/n → simulate topography.
- Inverse reasoning:
  - observe landscape → infer forcing.
  - given topography → estimate U, K, m/n.
- Important warning:
  - inversion is inherently non-unique.
  - multiple parameter sets can yield similar landscapes.
  
### Non-Uniqueness and Equifinality

Various parameter combinations can produce similar model outputs. This is known as **equifinality**. That is similar to multiple roads leading to the same destination, but the journey taken may differ significantly. Or as evolutionary biologists say, "convergent evolution"—different paths leading to similar forms (e.g., wings in bats and birds).

- Definition of equifinality:
  - multiple parameter sets → similar topography.
- Why equifinality is unavoidable:
  - unknown past climate,
  - spatially variable lithology,
  - incomplete boundary conditions.
- Consequence:
  > *Matching topography does not prove correctness.*

### Wrap-up 

- Key messages:
  - Data guide models, not validate them absolutely.
  - Agreement ≠ truth.
  - Focus on patterns, not exact fits.
