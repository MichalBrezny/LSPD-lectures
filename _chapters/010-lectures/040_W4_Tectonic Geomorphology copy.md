## Tectonics as fundamental boundary condition

>The unrelenting competition between tectonic processes that tend to build topography and surface processes that tend to tear them down represents the core of tectonic geomorphology. DW Burbank, RW Anderson, Tectonic Geomorphology (2011)

Tectonics is a primary driver of landscape evolution. It sets the long term and large scale boundary conditions within which surface processes operate. Tectonics influence erosion rates - higher uplift means more intensive erosion (as the elevation rises, the intensity of erosional processes intensifies). Tectonics also controls the spatial patterns of erosion and deposition, as well as the overall morphology of landscapes. The reason is that tectonic processes create **topographic gradients** that drive surface processes such as river incision, hillslope diffusion, and sediment transport.

## Modes of tectonic forcing
Tectonic forcing can manifest in several ways that impact landscape evolution:
1. **Uplift**: Vertical rise of the Earth's surface, which increases potential energy and drives erosion.
2. **Subsidence**: Vertical lowering of the Earth's surface, which can lead to sediment accumulation.
3. **Isostasy**: The gravitational equilibrium between the Earth's lithosphere and asthenosphere, which can cause uplift or subsidence in response to loading or unloading (e.g., erosion or sedimentation).
4. **Faulting and folding**: These processes can create localized topographic highs and lows, influencing drainage patterns and erosion rates.

## Geomorphic indicators of tectonic activity

As we want to measure tectonic activity e.g., uplift rates, we can use *geomorphic markers*. These are landforms, surfaces, linear trends which have these characteristics:
- we know  the initial geometry (e.g., flat surface)
- we know the age (e.g., dated river terrace)
- has a high preservation potential

Some of geomorphic markers:
- Planar surfaces:
  - marine terraces, beaches, shorelines
  - deltas
  - river terraces
  - alluvial fans
  - erosional surfaces
- Linear markers:
  - rivers, ridge crests
  - glacial moraines
