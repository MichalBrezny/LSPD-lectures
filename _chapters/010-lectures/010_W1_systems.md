# What is landscape?
>*Landscapes are suites of landforms which share a common genesis, contiguous location, and related history.*
>(Bierman & Montgomery 2014)

## Landscape as Open System
>*"A system is a structured set of objects and/or attributes. These objects and attributes consist of components or variables (i.e. phenomena which are free to assume variable magnitudes) that exhibit discernible relationships with one another and operate together as a complex whole, according to some observed pattern."*
>Chorley and Kennedy, 1971

There are three types of systems:
  - Open system - exchanges energy and matter with surroundings
  - Closed system - exchanges only energy with surroundings
  - Isolated system - does not exchange energy or matter with surroundings

The character of system is dependent on the choice of boundaries. Same system can be viewed differently depending on the boundaries chosen, which affects its qualities, inputs, and outputs (and whether it is open or isolated).

In the most basic sense, **landscape is an open system**. It involves exchange of energy and matter with surroundings and other systems.

# Unifying concepts
## Conservation of mass
Landscapes are **dynamic systems** through which mass is continually moving. Individual landforms can lose or gain mass over time; for example, rocky outcrops disaggregate and erode over time as they weather, but mass is conserved as it moves downslope. Eroded material is transformed by chemical reactions or physical abrasion as it moves, but it always ends up somewhere else. For example, a delta system at the mouth of a river grows because of input of sediment from upstream sources.

In geomorphic systems, a simple yet very useful concept is that the difference between inputs ($I$) and outputs ($O$) during some time period equals the change in storage ($ST$):  

$$ 
I - O =\delta ST 
$$

## Conservation of energy
**Energy cannot be created or destroyed**; it can only be transformed from one form to another. For example, potential energy – the energy associated with an object’s position – can be converted into kinetic energy, the energy of motion. A classic case is a boulder resting on a hill slope: at the top it stores gravitational potential energy, and as it begins to move downslope this potential energy is progressively transformed into kinetic energy. Water running down on slopes also transforms its potential energy to kinetic energy. Fraction of the energy is then used for the erosion.

## Material routing
**From source to sink**, most geomorphic transport is effectively one-way. Water flowing downstream through river networks, ice moving down glacial valleys, and soil and rock moving downslope under gravity are the predominant agents of mass transport on the continents. Together, these flows transfer material from upland source areas (where rock is uplifted and weathered) towards lowland sinks such as floodplains, lakes, and ultimately the oceans, where sediment is deposited and stored over longer timescales.

>[!NOTE]
> Some mass can be transported back upslope by biological activity (e.g., tree throw, animal burrowing) or human activities (e.g., terracing, mining), but these processes are generally of secondary importance at landscape scales.

## Balance of forces and thresholds
A **balance of forces** is an important concept in geomorphology. For example, in slope stability, some forces act to hold the slope together (resisting forces), while others act to drive particles on the slope to move (driving forces). Resisting forces include friction and the cohesive strength of soil or rock, whereas driving forces are primarily related to gravity acting on the mass of material and any additional loads (e.g. water). A slope remains stable as long as resisting forces exceed driving forces; once driving forces become greater, slope failure and mass movement can occur.

## Thresholds
In geomorphology, a threshold is a particular set of physical or chemical conditions at which the behaviour of a system changes abruptly. As long as conditions remain below this point, the landscape may appear relatively stable, even if it is slowly adjusting. Once the threshold is reached or exceeded, the system can shift to a different state or a new range of average conditions. Classic examples include a critical shear stress at which sediment on a river bed begins to move, a critical slope angle beyond which landslides are initiated, or chemical thresholds where changes in pH or redox conditions cause minerals to dissolve or precipitate. Crossing such thresholds often leads to rapid geomorphic change and reorganisation of landforms, even if the external forcing (such as climate or tectonics) varies only gradually.

## Inputs and Outputs
  - Inputs:
    - Tectonic uplift and crustal movements (vertical and horizontal).
    - Climate forcing (precipitation, temperature, glaciations).
    - Biotic effects (vegetation stabilizing slopes, human land use).
  - Outputs:
    - Sediment flux (bedload, suspended, dissolved).
    - Solute flux (weathering products).
    - Carbon flux (organic storage vs. oxidation).

## System Dynamics 

Equation of landscape change (change of elevation with time): 
$$∂z/∂t = U – E – D.$$

Where:
$U$: uplift (tectonic, isostatic).
$E$: erosion/incision (fluvial, glacial, aeolian).
$D$: diffusive hillslope processes.


## Landscape types

Bierman & Montgomery (2014) classify landscapes into 4 broad types:

- **Steady-state landscapes**: long-term balance between uplift and erosion. Characterized by mature landforms, stable drainage patterns, and equilibrium profiles.
- **Transient landscapes**: adjusting to recent changes in tectonics or climate. Characterized by disequilibrium profiles, migrating knickpoints, and evolving drainage networks.
- **Relict landscapes**: preserved remnants of past geomorphic conditions. Characterized by ancient landforms, low erosion rates, and limited active processes.
- **Ancient landscapes**: very old surfaces that have experienced minimal tectonic or climatic change. Characterized by deeply weathered profiles, subdued topography, and low relief.

### Steady State vs. Equilibrium vs. Transient

Steady state in broad view means balance between uplift and erosion. 


Equilibrium landscape means that it does not change through time. Equilibrium is not static but often dynamic steady state exists. That means, that system oscillates around some mean. Steady state is strongly scale dependent. For example, a landscape can be in steady state on million year timescale, but not on 1000 years timescale.

The average slope of a mountain range, for example, remains constant if erosion and rock uplift rates are equal over time, even if individual erosional events greatly change local slopes in the short term. The timescales over which topography equilibrates to changes in landscape-forming processes range from seasonal resurfacing of gravel streambeds following winter storms to the tens of millions of years it can take to erode mountain ranges.

Dynamic equilibrium: constant form but shifting position.

Landscapes may appear unchanging, but considered geologically, topography is dynamic because material is constantly being entrained, transported, and deposited. Over centuries to millennia, such changes result in a dynamic equilibrium that maintains topographic forms in an average sense even as individual slopes experience landslides; coastal landforms shift with currents, tides, and storms; and rivers migrate across their floodplains.
 
Transient state: system adjusting after disturbance. For example in the recently deglaciated landscapes so-called paraglacial adjustment occurs. Another example is river adjusting to base level fall after sea level drop.

## Feedback loops

In systems, feedback loops occur when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs, influencing subsequent system behavior. Feedbacks can be either positive or negative:
    - **Positive feedback** amplifies the initial change and drives the system further in the same direction.
    - **Negative feedback** counteracts the initial change and stabilizes the system. 

For example, in landscape evolution, a positive feedback loop can occur when increased erosion exposes more erodible material, leading to further erosion. Conversely, a negative feedback loop might involve vegetation growth stabilizing slopes and reducing erosion rates.
