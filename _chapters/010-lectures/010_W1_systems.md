## What is landscape?
*Landscapes are suites of landforms which share a common genesis, contiguous location, and related history.* (Bierman & Montgomery 2014)

## Landscape as Open System
"A system is a structured set of objects and/or attributes. These objects and attributes consist of components or variables (i.e. phenomena which are free to assume variable magnitudes) that exhibit discernible relationships with one another and operate together as a complex whole, according to some observed pattern." 
Chorley and Kennedy, 1971

There are three types of systems:

  - Open system - exchanges energy and matter with surroundings
  - Closed system - exchanges only energy with surroundings
  - Isolated system - does not exchange energy or matter with surroundings

The character of system is dependent on the choice of boundaries - the system can have different qualities and inputs and outputs based (and if it is open or isolated)

**Landscape is an open system**. It involves exchange of energy and matter with surroundings and other systems.

## Unifying concepts

### Conservation of mass
Landscapes are dynamic systems through which mass is continually moving. Individual landforms can lose or gain mass over time; for example, rocky outcrops disaggregate and erode over time as they weather, but mass is conserved as it moves downslope. Eroded material is transformed by chemical reactions or physical abrasion as it moves, but it always ends up somewhere else. For example, a delta system at the mouth of a river grows because of input of sediment from upstream sources.

In geomorphic systems, a simple yet very useful concept is that the difference between inputs (I) and outputs (O) during some time period equals the change in storage (ST):  
$$ I - O =\delta ST$$
#### Conservation of energy
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It only transforms from one to another.

For example potential energy, the energy of position can be converted into kinetic energy. Boulder on the hill.

Water running down on slopes also transforms it potential energy to kinetic energy. Fraction of the energy is then used for the erosion.

#### Material routing
From source to sink
Most of the transport is one way. A flow of water down river networks, of ice down glacial valley systems, and of soil and rock down hillslopes are the predominant agents of mass transport on the continents.

#### Balance of forces and thresholds
Balance of forces - important concept. For example slope stability - some forces hold slope together, other forces are driving particles on slope to move.

##### Thresholds
Physical or chemical conditions that, when reached or exceeded, triggers a change, shift to new state or a new range of average conditions

## Main leading factor in landscape evolution

### Inputs and Outputs
  - Inputs:
    - Tectonic uplift and crustal movements (vertical and horizontal).
    - Climate forcing (precipitation, temperature, glaciations).
    - Biotic effects (vegetation stabilizing slopes, human land use).
  - Outputs:
    - Sediment flux (bedload, suspended, dissolved).
    - Solute flux (weathering products).
    - Carbon flux (organic storage vs. oxidation).

### System Dynamics 
Equation of landscape change: 
$$∂z/∂t = U – E – D.$$

Where:
$U$: uplift (tectonic, isostatic).
$E$: erosion/incision (fluvial, glacial, aeolian).
$D$: diffusive hillslope processes.

## Steady-state vs. dynamic equilibrium:

Steady state in broad view means balance between uplift and erosion.
Equilibrium landscape = does not change through time. Equilibrium is not static but often dynamic steady state exists. That means, that system oscilates around some mean. Steady state is strongly scale dependent. For example, a landscape can be in steady state on million year timescale, but not on 1000 years timescale.

The average slope of a mountain range, for example, remains constant if erosion and rock uplift rates are equal over time, even if individual erosional events greatly change local slopes in the short term. The timescales over which topography equilibrates to changes in landscape-forming processes range from seasonal resurfacing of gravel streambeds following winter storms to the tens of millions of years it can take to erode mountain ranges.

Dynamic equilibrium: constant form but shifting position.

Landscapes may appear unchanging, but considered geologically, topography is dynamic because material is constantly being entrained, transported, and deposited. Over centuries to millennia, such changes result in a dynamic equilibrium that maintains topographic forms in an average sense even as individual slopes experience landslides; coastal landforms shift with currents, tides, and storms; and rivers migrate across their floodplains.
 
 
 
Transient state: system adjusting after disturbance.


Feedback loops:
    - Positive (accelerated incision after uplift).
    - Negative (vegetation reducing erosion).
