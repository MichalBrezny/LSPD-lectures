# From descriptive to quantitative geomorphology
The shift from descriptive to quantitative geomorphology represents a fundamental change in the way geomorphologists study and understand landscape processes. 

**Descriptive geomorphology** focuses on the classification and description of landforms and processes, often relying on qualitative observations and case studies. While this approach has provided valuable insights into the diversity of landscapes and their evolution, it has limitations in terms of reproducibility and predictive power.

**Quantitative geomorphology**, on the other hand, seeks to develop mathematical models and statistical methods to analyze and predict landscape change. This approach allows researchers to test hypotheses, explore relationships between variables, and make predictions about future landscape evolution. By incorporating quantitative methods, geomorphologists can better understand the complex interactions between processes and landforms, leading to more robust and generalizable findings.

## Historical development
The first model of landscape evolution was proposed by William Morris Davis in the late 19th century. His "cycle of erosion" model described a sequence of landscape development stages (youth, maturity, old age) based on qualitative observations. However, this model was criticized for its oversimplification and lack of consideration for dynamic processes.

In the mid-20th century, geomorphologists like Robert E. Hack introduced the concept of dynamic equilibrium, emphasizing the balance between tectonic uplift and erosion. This marked a shift towards understanding landscapes as dynamic systems influenced by various processes.
Subsequently, the development of process-based approaches and the integration of quantitative methods allowed for more rigorous analysis of landscape evolution. Techniques such as dimensional analysis, scaling laws, and numerical modeling have become essential tools in modern geomorphology.



### Davis's cycle of erosion
Uplift is short-lived compared to erosion. Therefore, landscapes evolve through a cycle of uplift and subsequent erosion. Davis proposed three main stages of landscape evolution:
1. **Youth**: Characterized by steep slopes, V-shaped valleys, and active downcutting by rivers.
2. **Maturity**: Slopes become gentler, valleys widen, and rivers develop floodplains.
3. **Old Age**: The landscape is nearly flat, with low relief and extensive peneplanation.

New uplift rejuvenate the landscape and restarts the cycle.

### Penck's model of landscape evolution
Walther Penck's model (1953) emphasized the continuous interplay between uplift and erosion. Unlike Davis, Penck proposed that uplift and erosion occur simultaneously. Uplift increases over time until it reaches its climax and then slowly declines. Erosion responds immediately to changes in uplift rates, leading to a more dynamic view of landscape evolution.

### Hack
Hack (1960s) introduced the concept of dynamic equilibrium in landscapes. He argued that landscapes adjust to a balance between tectonic uplift and erosional processes. In this view, landscapes are constantly evolving but tend to maintain a state of equilibrium over long timescales. Hack's work laid the foundation for modern process-based geomorphology, emphasizing the importance of quantifying landscape processes.

## Benefits of quantification
Quantifying landscape systems offers several advantages:
- **Reproducibility**: Quantitative methods allow for consistent measurements and analyses, enabling other researchers to replicate studies and validate findings.
- **Hypothesis testing**: Quantitative approaches facilitate the formulation and testing of hypotheses about landscape processes and evolution.
- **Predictive capacity**: Mathematical models can be used to predict future landscape changes under different scenarios, aiding in land management and hazard assessment.
- **Integration of data**: Quantitative methods enable the integration of diverse datasets (e.g., topographic, climatic, geological) for comprehensive analyses.
- **Understanding complexity**: Quantitative approaches help unravel the complex interactions between multiple processes shaping landscapes.
- **Communication**: Quantitative results can be more easily communicated to stakeholders, policymakers, and the public.
- **Advancement of theory**: Quantification drives the development of new theories and models in geomorphology.
- **Technological integration**: Advances in technology (e.g., remote sensing, GIS) enhance the ability to collect and analyze quantitative data.
- **Interdisciplinary collaboration**: Quantitative geomorphology facilitates collaboration with other scientific disciplines (e.g., hydrology, ecology, climatology).
- **Resource management**: Quantitative insights inform sustainable land use and conservation strategies.
- **Risk assessment**: Quantitative models aid in assessing geomorphic hazards (e.g., landslides, floods).
- **Policy development**: Quantitative data supports evidence-based policymaking for environmental management.
- **Educational value**: Quantitative geomorphology enhances the training of future scientists in analytical and modeling skills.
- **Innovation**: Quantification drives innovation in research methods and technologies in geomorphology.
- **Global change studies**: Quantitative approaches are essential for understanding and predicting the impacts of global environmental changes on landscapes.
- **Data-driven insights**: Quantitative analyses provide data-driven insights that can inform decision-making in various sectors (e.g., urban planning, agriculture).
- **Benchmarking**: Quantitative metrics allow for benchmarking landscape conditions and changes over time.
- **Enhanced visualization**: Quantitative data can be visualized through graphs, maps, and models, aiding in interpretation and communication of results.
- **Standardization**: Quantitative methods promote standardization in data collection and analysis, facilitating comparisons across studies and regions.
- **Long-term monitoring**: Quantitative approaches enable long-term monitoring of landscape changes, providing insights into trends and patterns over time.
- **Improved accuracy**: Quantitative measurements enhance the accuracy of landscape analyses, reducing subjectivity and bias.
- **Facilitation of large-scale studies**: Quantitative methods allow for the analysis of large datasets, enabling regional to global-scale studies of landscape processes and changes.

## Concepts of scaling and dimensional analysis
Scaling and dimensional analysis are essential tools in quantitative geomorphology. They help to understand how landscape processes and landforms change with size and time.
- **Scaling**: Examines how geomorphic processes and landforms change with size. For example, the relationship between river discharge and channel width can be described using scaling laws.
- **Dimensional analysis**: A mathematical technique used to derive relationships between physical quantities by analyzing their dimensions (e.g., length, time, mass). This approach helps to identify key variables and formulate dimensionless numbers that characterize geomorphic processes.   
- **Applications**: Scaling and dimensional analysis are used to develop empirical relationships, validate numerical models, and interpret field data in geomorphology.
- **Examples**: The Shields parameter, a dimensionless number used to predict sediment transport initiation, is derived using dimensional analysis.

### Examples of simple quantitative models
1. **Box models**: Simplified representations of landscape systems that use mass balance equations to track inputs, outputs, and storage of sediment or other materials.
2. **Balance equations**: Mathematical equations that describe the balance between different geomorphic processes, such as erosion and deposition, to predict landscape evolution over time.
3. **Stream power law**: A quantitative model that relates river incision rates to channel slope and discharge, providing insights into landscape evolution driven by fluvial processes.
