# From descriptive to quantitative geomorphology
The shift from descriptive to quantitative geomorphology represents a fundamental change in the way geomorphologists study and understand landscape processes. 

**Descriptive geomorphology** focuses on the classification and description of landforms and processes, often relying on qualitative observations and case studies. While this approach has provided valuable insights into the diversity of landscapes and their evolution, it has limitations in terms of reproducibility and predictive power.

**Quantitative geomorphology**, on the other hand, seeks to develop mathematical models and statistical methods to analyze and predict landscape change. This approach allows researchers to test hypotheses, explore relationships between variables, and make predictions about future landscape evolution. By incorporating quantitative methods, geomorphologists can better understand the complex interactions between processes and landforms, leading to more robust and generalizable findings.

## Historical development
The first model of landscape evolution was proposed by William Morris Davis in the late 19th century. His "cycle of erosion" model described a sequence of landscape development stages (youth, maturity, old age) based on qualitative observations. However, this model was criticized for its oversimplification and lack of consideration for dynamic processes.

In the mid-20th century, geomorphologists like Robert E. Hack introduced the concept of dynamic equilibrium, emphasizing the balance between tectonic uplift and erosion. This marked a shift towards understanding landscapes as dynamic systems influenced by various processes.
Subsequently, the development of process-based approaches and the integration of quantitative methods allowed for more rigorous analysis of landscape evolution. Techniques such as dimensional analysis, scaling laws, and numerical modeling have become essential tools in modern geomorphology.

### Davis's cycle of erosion
Uplift is short-lived compared to erosion. Therefore, landscapes evolve through a cycle of uplift and subsequent erosion. Davis proposed three main stages of landscape evolution:
1. **Youth**: Characterized by steep slopes, V-shaped valleys, and active downcutting by rivers.
2. **Maturity**: Slopes become gentler, valleys widen, and rivers develop floodplains.
3. **Old Age**: The landscape is nearly flat, with low relief and extensive peneplanation.

New uplift rejuvenate the landscape and restarts the cycle.

### Penck's model of landscape evolution
Walther Penck's model (1953) emphasized the continuous interplay between uplift and erosion. Unlike Davis, Penck proposed that uplift and erosion occur simultaneously. Uplift increases over time until it reaches its climax and then slowly declines. Erosion responds immediately to changes in uplift rates, leading to a more dynamic view of landscape evolution.

### Hack
Hack (1960s) introduced the concept of dynamic equilibrium in landscapes. He argued that landscapes adjust to a balance between tectonic uplift and erosional processes. In this view, landscapes are constantly evolving but tend to maintain a state of equilibrium over long timescales. Hack's work laid the foundation for modern process-based geomorphology, emphasizing the importance of quantifying landscape processes.

## Modelling in geomorphology
Landscape is a complex system with many components which interacts in many different ways. To understand such complex systems, we create models, that simplify reality and help us to understand how the system works. Models can be conceptual, physical or mathematical/numerical.

Huggett (1993) defines models in geomorphology as "simplified representations of reality that are designed to explain, predict or control aspects of the behaviour of geomorphic systems". Models can be classified into three main types:
1. **Conceptual models**: These are qualitative representations of geomorphic systems, often in the form of diagrams or flowcharts. They help to visualize the relationships between different components of a system and to generate hypotheses about how the system functions. They may serve as a basis for developing more quantitative models.
2. **Physical models**: These are scaled-down versions of geomorphic systems that can be manipulated in a laboratory setting. Physical models allow researchers to observe and measure the behaviour of geomorphic processes under controlled conditions.
3. **Mathematical/numerical models**: These use mathematical equations to represent geomorphic processes and predict landscape evolution. Numerical models can simulate complex interactions between multiple processes and can be used to test hypotheses and explore scenarios that are difficult to study in the field.

In the figure above, slightly different division of models is presented. Hardware models refer to physical models, its subcategory **scale models** refers to physical models that are scaled down versions of real-world systems. **Analogue models** are thought to be maps, remote sensing, but also scaled models which use analoguous materials to represent or demonstrate processes in the scaled reality (with problems arising with findigs of suitable materials). models that use different materials or processes to represent geomorphic systems, often to study specific aspects of landscape evolution. **Mathematical models** and **numerical models** correspond to the mathematical/numerical models described by Huggett (1993). We can also distinguish probabilistic models, which incorporate randomness and uncertainty into their predictions, often using statistical methods to analyze geomorphic data and deterministic models, which use fixed relationships between variables to predict landscape evolution.

## Concepts of scaling and dimensional analysis
Scaling and dimensional analysis are essential tools in quantitative geomorphology. They help to understand how landscape processes and landforms change with size and time.
- **Scaling**: Examines how geomorphic processes and landforms change with size. For example, the relationship between river discharge and channel width can be described using scaling laws.
- **Dimensional analysis**: A mathematical technique used to derive relationships between physical quantities by analyzing their dimensions (e.g., length, time, mass). This approach helps to identify key variables and formulate dimensionless numbers that characterize geomorphic processes.   
- **Applications**: Scaling and dimensional analysis are used to develop empirical relationships, validate numerical models, and interpret field data in geomorphology.
- **Examples**: The Shields parameter, a dimensionless number used to predict sediment transport initiation, is derived using dimensional analysis.

### Examples of simple quantitative models
1. **Box models**: Simplified representations of landscape systems that use mass balance equations to track inputs, outputs, and storage of sediment or other materials.
2. **Balance equations**: Mathematical equations that describe the balance between different geomorphic processes, such as erosion and deposition, to predict landscape evolution over time.
3. **Stream power law**: A quantitative model that relates river incision rates to channel slope and discharge, providing insights into landscape evolution driven by fluvial processes.
