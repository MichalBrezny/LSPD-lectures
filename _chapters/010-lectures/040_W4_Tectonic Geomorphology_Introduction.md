# Introduction: Why Tectonics Matters

>*The unrelenting competition between tectonic processes that tend to build topography and surface processes that tend to tear them down represents the core of tectonic geomorphology.* 
>DW Burbank, RW Anderson, Tectonic Geomorphology (2011)

Tectonics is a primary driver of landscape evolution. It sets the long term and large scale boundary conditions within which surface processes operate. Tectonics influence erosion rates - higher uplift means more intensive erosion (as the elevation rises, the intensity of erosional processes intensifies). Tectonics also controls the spatial patterns of erosion and deposition, as well as the overall morphology of landscapes. The reason is that tectonic processes create **topographic gradients** that drive surface processes such as river incision, hillslope diffusion, and sediment transport.

Thus:
- Landscapes do not generate relief on their own.
- Relief production requires **tectonic forcing**:
  - crustal shortening and thickening,
  - faulting and folding,
  - isostatic adjustment.


## Types of Tectonic Forcing

### Vertical Motions
- Rock uplift vs. surface uplift:
  - rock uplift: motion of rock relative to geoid,
  - surface uplift: change in land surface elevation.
- Mechanisms:
  - crustal thickening,
  - mantle dynamics,
  - flexural and erosional isostasy.
- Spatial patterns of uplift:
  - uniform uplift,
  - block uplift,
  - fault-controlled uplift.

### Horizontal Deformation
- Shortening and extension:
  - fold-and-thrust belts,
  - rift systems.
- Strike-slip deformation:
  - lateral offsets,
  - pull-apart basins.
- Consequences for drainage:
  - river deflection,
  - drainage capture,
  - basin tilting.


## Modes of tectonic forcing
Tectonic forcing can manifest in several ways that impact landscape evolution:
1. **Uplift**: Vertical rise of the Earth's surface, which increases potential energy and drives erosion.
2. **Subsidence**: Vertical lowering of the Earth's surface, which can lead to sediment accumulation.
3. **Isostasy**: The gravitational equilibrium between the Earth's lithosphere and asthenosphere, which can cause uplift or subsidence in response to loading or unloading (e.g., erosion or sedimentation).
4. **Faulting and folding**: These processes can create localized topographic highs and lows, influencing drainage patterns and erosion rates.

## Geomorphic Responses to Tectonic Forcing

### Channel Response
- Increase in channel slope to balance uplift.
- Incision rates adjusting to uplift rates.
- Formation of knickpoints and knickzones.
### Basin Response
- Changes in drainage area and network geometry.
- Alteration of sediment supply and transport.
- Drainage basin tilting and asymmetry.

###  Hillslope Response
- Relief growth leads to steeper slopes.
- Increased frequency of threshold processes (landslides).
- Coupling between uplift, incision, and mass wasting.

### Transient Adjustment
- Time lag between uplift and geomorphic response.
- Concept of response time and landscape memory.
- Inherited topography vs. active forcing.

### 4. Conceptual Models (20 min)

#### 4.1 Steady-State Orogen
- Uplift balanced by erosion.
- Constant mean elevation.
- Rivers in equilibrium with tectonic forcing.

#### 4.2 Transient Orogen
- Change in uplift rate or pattern.
- Rivers steepen, knickpoints migrate.
- Hillslopes adjust more slowly than channels.

#### 4.3 Limitations
- Lithologic control.
- Climate modulation.
- Role of sediment cover.

### 5. Wrap-up Discussion (10 min)
- Key message:
  > *Topography is a filtered tectonic signal.*
- Discussion questions:
  - Can two landscapes with the same uplift rate look different?
  - How long does it take for tectonic signals to appear in topography?


## Geomorphic indicators of tectonic activity

As we want to measure tectonic activity e.g., uplift rates, we can use *geomorphic markers*. These are landforms, surfaces, linear trends which have these characteristics:
- we know  the initial geometry (e.g., flat surface)
- we know the age (e.g., dated river terrace)
- has a high preservation potential

Some of geomorphic markers:
- Planar surfaces:
  - marine terraces, beaches, shorelines
  - deltas
  - river terraces
  - alluvial fans
  - erosional surfaces
- Linear markers:
  - rivers, ridge crests
  - glacial moraines

## Lecture 2: Geomorphic Indicators of Active Tectonics

### 1. Introduction: Reading Tectonics from Topography (5 min)
- Motivation:
  - We rarely observe uplift directly.
  - We infer tectonics from **geomorphic proxies**.
- Emphasize that indicators are **indirect and non-unique**.

## Lab: Quantitative Tectonic Geomorphology from DEMs

### Objectives
- Identify tectonic signatures in real topography.
- Practice geomorphic interpretation prior to modeling.

---

### Step-by-Step Activities

1. **DEM Exploration**
   - Load DEM of tectonically active region.
   - Identify major structural features visually.

2. **River Profile Extraction**
   - Extract longitudinal profiles.
   - Identify steep reaches and knickpoints.

3. **Hypsometric Analysis**
   - Generate hypsometric curves for multiple basins.
   - Compare integrals between basins.

4. **Basin Asymmetry**
   - Calculate basin asymmetry factor.
   - Interpret basin tilting directions.

5. **Synthesis Exercise**
   - Combine all indicators.
   - Answer:
     - Is the landscape actively uplifting?
     - What alternative explanations exist?

---

### Deliverables
- Figures:
  - river profiles,
  - hypsometric curves,
  - asymmetry maps.
- Short interpretation report (2–3 pages):
  - evidence for tectonic forcing,
  - uncertainty and alternative hypotheses.

## Pedagogical Notes (Instructor)

- Avoid presenting tectonic metrics as “truth”.
- Emphasize uncertainty and ambiguity.
- Reinforce idea that:
  > *Geomorphology records tectonics imperfectly, but systematically.*

- This block should **reduce confusion** later when students encounter:
  - chi plots,
  - ksn maps,
  - uplift parameters in models.
