## Week 11 – Applications and Case Studies
### Lecture 1: Applied Quantitative Geomorphology
**Structure**
- **Introduction (5 min)**
  - From theory to practice.
- **Core Concepts (25 min)**
  - Hazard applications:
    - Flood risk modeling.
    - Landslide susceptibility.
    - Debris flow routing.
  - Restoration:
    - Sediment budgets for river restoration.
    - Reconnecting floodplains.
  - Land use impacts:
    - Agriculture, deforestation, mining.
- **Examples (10 min)**
  - Nepal: landslide risk mapping.
  - Mississippi: sediment load changes after dams.
- **Wrap-up (5 min)**
  - Q: How can LEMs support decision-making?

### Lecture 2: Case Studies & Anthropocene Geomorphology
**Structure**
- **Introduction (5 min)**
  - Humans as geomorphic agents.
- **Core Concepts (25 min)**
  - Case studies:
    - Himalaya: tectonics vs. climate.
    - Andes: uplift and precipitation gradients.
  - Anthropocene geomorphology:
    - Dams altering sediment flux.
    - Mining and land cover change.
    - Urbanization impacts.
- **Examples (10 min)**
  - Three Gorges Dam sediment trapping.
- **Wrap-up (5 min)**
  - Debate: humans vs. glaciers – which reshapes landscapes faster?

### Lab 10: Project Design Workshop
**Objectives**
- Develop and refine final project ideas.
- Practice peer review.

**Steps**
1. **Students present 5-min project pitches**.
2. **Peer feedback** in small groups.
3. **Instructor guidance** on feasibility and datasets.
4. **Exercise**
   - Submit 1-page project plan with objectives and methods.
