# Tectonic Geomorphic Indicators and Metrics
## Channel-Based Indicators 

### Channel Steepness (Conceptual)
- Steepness as a response to uplift.
- Relationship between slope, discharge, and erosion.
- Intuition behind channel steepness indices.

#### Knickpoints and Knickzones
- Types:
  - tectonic knickpoints,
  - lithologic knickpoints,
  - base-level knickpoints.
- Migration vs. fixed knickpoints.
- Using knickpoints as timing indicators.

#### Drainage Network Organization
- Asymmetric drainage basins.
- River deflection and offset.
- Beheaded streams and captures.

### 3. Basin-Scale Indicators (25 min)

#### 3.1 Hypsometry
- Hypsometric curve:
  - cumulative area vs. elevation.
- Hypsometric integral:
  - youthful vs. mature basins.
- Interpreting hypsometry cautiously:
  - tectonics vs. climate vs. lithology.

#### 3.2 Basin Asymmetry
- Basin tilt and lateral migration.
- Asymmetry factor (AF).
- Links to active faulting and warping.

### 4. Integrating Indicators (20 min)

- No single metric proves tectonic activity.
- Strength lies in **converging evidence**:
  - steep channels + asymmetric basins,
  - knickpoints aligned across basins,
  - consistency with known faults.
- Importance of scale:
  - reach-scale vs. basin-scale signals.
- Preparing ground for:
  - chi analysis,
  - ksn mapping,
  - SPIM interpretation.

### 5. Wrap-up and Transition (10 min)
- Key takeaways:
  - Tectonic geomorphology is interpretative.
  - Metrics quantify responses, not causes.
- Explicit transition:
  > *Next, we introduce χ-analysis as a tool to formalize and quantify these tectonic signals in river networks.*
