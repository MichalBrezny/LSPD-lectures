# Tectonic Geomorphic Indicators and Metrics

As we want to measure tectonic activity e.g., uplift rates, we can use *geomorphic markers*. These are landforms, surfaces, linear trends which have these characteristics:
- we know  the initial geometry (e.g., flat surface)
- we know the age (e.g., dated river terrace)
- has a high preservation potential

Some of geomorphic markers:
- Planar surfaces:
  - marine terraces, beaches, shorelines
  - deltas
  - river terraces
  - alluvial fans
  - erosional surfaces
- Linear markers:
  - rivers, ridge crests
  - glacial moraines

## Channel-Based Indicators 

### Channel Steepness (Conceptual)
- **Steepness as a response to uplift** - higher uplift rates require steeper channels to transport sediment.

- Intuition behind channel steepness indices.

#### Knickpoints and Knickzones
- Types:
  - tectonic knickpoints,
  - lithologic knickpoints,
  - base-level knickpoints.
- Migration vs. fixed knickpoints.
- Using knickpoints as timing indicators.

#### Drainage Network Organization
- Asymmetric drainage basins.
- River deflection and offset.
- Beheaded streams and captures.

### 3. Basin-Scale Indicators 
#### 3.1 Hypsometry
- Hypsometric curve:
  - cumulative area vs. elevation.
- Hypsometric integral:
  - youthful vs. mature basins.
- Interpreting hypsometry cautiously:
  - tectonics vs. climate vs. lithology.

#### 3.2 Basin Asymmetry
- Basin tilt and lateral migration.
- Asymmetry factor (AF).
- Links to active faulting and warping.

### 4. Integrating Indicators

- No single metric proves tectonic activity.
- Strength lies in **converging evidence**:
  - steep channels + asymmetric basins,
  - knickpoints aligned across basins,
  - consistency with known faults.
- Importance of scale:
  - reach-scale vs. basin-scale signals.
- Preparing ground for:
  - chi analysis,
  - ksn mapping,
  - SPIM interpretation.

### Evolution of fault scarp
Fresh fault scarp has sharp eedge. Over time, diffusive processes smooth the scarp. It is possible to estimate age of the scarp from its shape using diffusion model.

### Wrap-up and Transition
- Key takeaways:
  - Tectonic geomorphology is interpretative.
  - Metrics quantify responses, not causes.

> *Next, we introduce χ-analysis as a tool to formalize and quantify these tectonic signals in river networks.*
