## Course Overview

Landscape evolution reflects the integrated response of the Earth’s surface to tectonic forcing, climate, and surface processes operating over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Rivers incise, hillslopes adjust, glaciers reshape valleys, and sediment is transferred through landscapes in complex, often transient ways. Understanding these processes requires moving beyond descriptive geomorphology toward quantitative, process-based approaches.

This course provides advanced training in quantitative geomorphology and landscape evolution, with a particular focus on fluvial systems, tectonic forcing, and numerical modeling. Students will learn how digital elevation models (DEMs), river profile analysis, and physically motivated models such as the Stream Power Incision Model (SPIM) and Landscape Evolution Models (LEMs) are used to investigate how landscapes respond to uplift, climate change, and base-level perturbations.

The course emphasizes conceptual understanding over technical mastery. Students are not expected to develop new numerical models or perform full-scale calibration; instead, they will learn to:
- interpret model behavior,
- understand underlying assumptions,
- recognize uncertainty and equifinality,
- and critically link model results with geomorphic observations.

Practical sessions form a core component of the course. Through guided laboratories, students will work with DEMs, GIS-based terrain analysis, and pre-built modeling frameworks (e.g. Landlab) to explore landscape dynamics in a hands-on manner. These exercises are designed as numerical experiments, allowing students to test hypotheses and develop intuition about process interactions rather than focusing on programming complexity.

By the end of the course, students will be able to critically evaluate quantitative geomorphic analyses in the scientific literature, understand how landscapes record tectonic and climatic signals, and apply modern tools to investigate Earth surface processes. The course is particularly well suited for students interested in geomorphology, Earth surface processes, and research-oriented or applied careers in Earth and environmental sciences.

### Structure
The course is structured into weekly modules, each focusing on a specific theme related to landscape evolution. Each week includes:
- Lecture (1.5 hours) covering theoretical concepts and practical applications.
- A laboratory session (1.5 hours) where students apply concepts using real-world data and modeling tools.
- Reading assignments from key literature to reinforce lecture topics.
